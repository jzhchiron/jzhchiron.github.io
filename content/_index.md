        I have published a series of papers in the field of philosophy, some of which have sparked discussions on various forums. The topics of these discussed papers include Jin Yuelin–Feng Qi, Kurt Gödel, Alain Badiou, cognitive science, virtue theory, Wang Hao and Quentin Meillassoux.

        Currently, I am conducting research at the intersection of number theory and model theory under the supervision of Professor William Andrew Johnson at the School of Mathematical Sciences and the School of Philosophy, Fudan University, as well as research on dynamic neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence under the guidance of Professor Zhang Min at the Software Engineering Institute, East China Normal University.
